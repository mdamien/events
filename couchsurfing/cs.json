    "description": "Wanna be on French National TV :) in Paris, Île-de-France, France at Jun 23, 2015, 12:00 AM (CEST). A friend of mine is looking for fellow Couch surfers for one of her projects that soon will be filmed by a team from French National TV. Here is her message for you guys! :)\r\n\r\n\"Are you in Paris from June 23-27? Do you want to be on TV?\r\n\r\nI am a startup founder based in Toronto.  My startup connects you with locals who share your interests – like having a friend show you their home city. You can check out a one-minute video on Youtube here: http://bit.ly/1GfU3nf\r\n\r\nI just learned that my startup might be featured on a prime-time TV show in France, with an average viewership of 4.5 million people. The show will be about new ways of travelling and they are interested in filming one our tours in action.  \r\n\r\nIf you will be in Paris during that period and are not camera shy, or know of someone else, please let JB know about it (preferably through PM).  The journalist has indicated that he would prefer to film a group (2-4 people is ideal) so that the group can interact.  Obviously the tour will be free.  I will be giving away 4 free tours (2 hours long) so that I can propose different date /time options.  \r\n\r\nIn your response please indicate:\r\n\r\n1. Where you are from, a little bit about you\r\n2. Who you are travelling with\r\n3. What days you are in Paris\r\n4. What specific date and time you would want the tour\r\n5. If there's anything specific you would like to see during the tour\r\n\r\nThe show is documentary style so there is no acting involved. It would really be a fun, unique thing you can do while you're in Paris. \"",

    "description": "Open mic & jam every thursday in Paris, Île-de-France, France at Jun 25, 2015,  8:30 PM (CEST). I've been organizing those events weekly for the past 3 years with my talented singers and musicians friends that I have met on different concerts and TV shows in my 15 years in Paris, so you can hear some pretty cool artists and it's very nice to come and listen, or even play if you feel like it :) As I host a lot of couchsurfers and also post the event there and on Meetup, the atmosphere is quite international too with a pre-meeting with international travellers & expats from 8.30 to 9.30 before the music starts so people can get to know each other.\r\n\r\nThe drinks are pretty cheap compared to Paris prices, with happy hour prices all evening. And the bar is very central and easy to find, right by the métro exit in Saint-Michel. When the crowd is wild and we wanna keep playing, we actually often continue the jam by the river after 2 am.\r\n\r\nThe music usually starts around 9.30 but the Meeting starts at 8.30 so we can have time for drinks and get to know each other before I have to open the live session. You can find me easily (behind the sound counsol) if you arrive late though and I can point you to the Couchsurfers group.\r\n\r\nThe type of music depends on the performers who will show up. It's mostly pop, folk, rock, blues, soul, sometimes reggae, world music or rap. A little jazz sometimes, but it's mostly mainstream music.\r\n\r\nAll the sound system is in place and you can also borrow my electro acoustic guitar if you need, but it's still better to bring your own instrument if it can be plugged.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the quality of the performances for the audience, the first time performers should send me a link to one of their work or live videos, or you will have to play when the room is less crowded so I can know if I can release you in the wild jungle of a crowded audience later :)\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ INFO ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nBar : Le Carré Saint michel Address : 4, Rue Suger, 75006 Metro-RER : Saint Michel (line 4 - RER B). The rue Suger is facing the métro exit \"place Saint-André-des-Arts\" so it's very easy to find. If you get off at any other exit, then you have to go right on the Saint-Michel fountain and you'll be on place Saint-André-des-Arts. From the place, 2 streets go right, the rue Suger is the second one.\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ PRICES ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nIt's cover free but the bar owner won't be happy if you don't get at least one drink to help out the bar and the artists ;) The prices are cheaper than most places in Paris :\r\n\r\n✪ Various shots : 3,5 € ✪ Glasses of wine : 4 € ✪ Beer Pints : 4.5 € ✪ Cocktails : 6 €\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nRDV à partir de 20h30 au Carré Saint-Michel pour l'Open Mic & Jam du jeudi ! Un niveau correct est requis pour chanter 2 à 3 chansons ou pour jammer avec les habitués du Carré pour garantir un show de qualité au public. Les musiciens et chanteurs habitués sont issus des meilleures rencontres musicales que j'ai pu faire lors de mes 14 ans de musique à Paris, dans divers concerts ou même quelques émissions de TV comme Nouvelle Star, The Voice, X-Factor ou Popstars donc il y a pas mal de voix étonnantes :)\r\n",

Hey Folks !!\r\n\r\nFor those who like football we can play on saturday (12:30pm to 2:30pm) at \"Plateau de Malakoff\". That's very cool as there are few pitch (if we are enough, we can play 7 vs 7 on a synthetic grass (on the width of a classic field). If we are not much, there is a cage (4 vs 4). The goal of this event is to see if we are enough to play. Please confirm your presence by sending a quick post on the tread.\r\nAlso please be on time, it wastes everybody's time when we have to rebalance the teams every 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nSee you on Saturdays !\r\n\r\nJon\r\n\r\nP.S. Don't forget to bring water and your soccer shoes !\r\n\r\nMap: Check on googlemaps, it's 3min by walking down the street from the metro.\r\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/AAt4f",

ENGLISH BELOW\r\n\r\nUne escapade sur les bords de la Marne avec croisière et randonnée dans un parc naturel. Programme de la journée :\r\n\r\n09h31 : départ de la Gare de l’Est en Transilien P\r\n\r\n09h55 : arrivée à la gare de Lagny-Thorigny, marche jusqu’à l’embarcadère de Dampmart\r\n\r\n11h : croisière sur la Marne (participation 1 euro)\r\n\r\nVers 12h : pique-nique partagé (merci d’apporter à manger et à boire)\r\n\r\n12h55 ou 13h25 : départ de la gare de Lagny-Thorigny pour Meaux\r\n\r\n13h10 ou 13h40 : arrivée à Meaux.

Si vous n’avez pas de passe Navigo, prévoir 17,35 euros pour les trois tickets dont vous aurez besoin.\r\n\r\n2) S’il fait vraiment mauvais, on annulera la randonnée.\r\n\r\n3) Le rendez-vous est près du guichet « Vente Ile-de-France » à la Gare de l’Est. Quand vous sortez de la gare en suivant les panneaux « Accès aux trains / Trains Ile-de-France », vous sortez vers les quais. Le guichet « Vente Ile-de-France » se trouve en face, près des quais. (Voir http://i.imgur.com/2dt61n8.jpg) Je serai là entre 09h15 et 09h25, merci de venir avant 09h25. À 09h25 nous nous dirigerons vers le train et monterons dedans.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nA one-day getaway from Paris to the banks of the Marne and a hike in a nature reserve.

Hike in the nature reserve of Pâtis.\r\nTaking 150 hectares, the park presents a great diversity of landscapes (ponds, banks of the Marne river, flowered meadows, a reed bed, woods) and is home to not less than 70 bird species.\r\n\r\nAround 5 p.m.: departure for Paris\r\n\r\nGood to know :\r\n\r\n1) If you have a monthly or annual Navigo transport card, whatever zones you have with your subscription, the card covers all zones on weekends. If you don’t, the three paper tickets you will need will cost 17,35 euros.\r\n\r\n2) If the weather gets really poor, the hike will be cancelled.\r\n\r\n3) The meeting point is near the ticket booth “Vente Ile-de-France” at Gare de l’Est train station. When you walk out of the station, follow the signs “Accès aux trains / Trains Ile-de-France”, and you will reach the platforms. The ticket booth “Vente Ile-de-France” is just in front, near the platforms. (See http://i.imgur.com/2dt61n8.jpg) I will be there between 09.15 and 09.25 a.m., please come before 09.25.

We see a wide variety of film, from old black and white classics, to cult hits, or modern alternative films. We choose a different cinema each week and a different style, but one thing remains, we do this, and have done this, every week since June 2011. If you're a traveller don't worry, we always watch English language films, and if you're french, don't worry, they always have subtitles. After the film we usually hang around and take a beer at a bar or along the Seine if the weather is nice and talk about the film, cheese, the finer things in life or whatever might float our way. Come along and enjoy good cinema and good company. \r\n\r\nDetails of this week's film will be online by the SUNDAY before the event. \r\n\r\n---Paris Cinéma Club---\r\nSo an Argentinian, an Australian and a Frenchman walk into a cinema… Every week night since June 2011, a different cinema, a different film, a cinematic experience and a beer.

    "description": "Open mic & jam every thursday in Paris, Île-de-France, France at Jul 02, 2015,  8:30 PM (CEST). I've been organizing those events weekly for the past 3 years with my talented singers and musicians friends that I have met on different concerts and TV shows in my 15 years in Paris, so you can hear some pretty cool artists and it's very nice to come and listen, or even play if you feel like it :) As I host a lot of couchsurfers and also post the event there and on Meetup, the atmosphere is quite international too with a pre-meeting with international travellers & expats from 8.30 to 9.30 before the music starts so people can get to know each other.\r\n\r\nThe drinks are pretty cheap compared to Paris prices, with happy hour prices all evening. And the bar is very central and easy to find, right by the métro exit in Saint-Michel. When the crowd is wild and we wanna keep playing, we actually often continue the jam by the river after 2 am.\r\n\r\nThe music usually starts around 9.30 but the Meeting starts at 8.30 so we can have time for drinks and get to know each other before I have to open the live session. You can find me easily (behind the sound counsol) if you arrive late though and I can point you to the Couchsurfers group.\r\n\r\nThe type of music depends on the performers who will show up. It's mostly pop, folk, rock, blues, soul, sometimes reggae, world music or rap. A little jazz sometimes, but it's mostly mainstream music.\r\n\r\nAll the sound system is in place and you can also borrow my electro acoustic guitar if you need, but it's still better to bring your own instrument if it can be plugged.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the quality of the performances for the audience, the first time performers should send me a link to one of their work or live videos, or you will have to play when the room is less crowded so I can know if I can release you in the wild jungle of a crowded audience later :)\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ INFO ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nBar : Le Carré Saint michel Address : 4, Rue Suger, 75006 Metro-RER : Saint Michel (line 4 - RER B). The rue Suger is facing the métro exit \"place Saint-André-des-Arts\" so it's very easy to find. If you get off at any other exit, then you have to go right on the Saint-Michel fountain and you'll be on place Saint-André-des-Arts. From the place, 2 streets go right, the rue Suger is the second one.\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ PRICES ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nIt's cover free but the bar owner won't be happy if you don't get at least one drink to help out the bar and the artists ;) The prices are cheaper than most places in Paris :\r\n\r\n✪ Various shots : 3,5 € ✪ Glasses of wine : 4 € ✪ Beer Pints : 4.5 € ✪ Cocktails : 6 €\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nRDV à partir de 20h30 au Carré Saint-Michel pour l'Open Mic & Jam du jeudi ! Un niveau correct est requis pour chanter 2 à 3 chansons ou pour jammer avec les habitués du Carré pour garantir un show de qualité au public. Les musiciens et chanteurs habitués sont issus des meilleures rencontres musicales que j'ai pu faire lors de mes 14 ans de musique à Paris, dans divers concerts ou même quelques émissions de TV comme Nouvelle Star, The Voice, X-Factor ou Popstars donc il y a pas mal de voix étonnantes :)\r\n",

    "description": "Pub Crawl in Bastille in Paris, Île-de-France, France at Jul 04, 2015,  8:00 PM (CEST). Hey ladies and gents,\r\n\r\nYou ever try a real Parisian pub crawl? Now’s your chance to get your drink on with your favorite Parisian gal (or guy) in the historically badass Bastille.\r\n\r\nFor those who don’t sais, the Bastille is a well-known fortress where the French revolution took place. Over time, it’s become a hugely popular spot for pubs and partying. One of its most famous streets, rue de Lappe, is called the “thirsty street,” which pretty much speaks for itself….\r\n\r\nCome and join me for an unforgettable night of pub-crawling the Bastille!\r\n\r\nFirst, get your pass:\r\n\r\n· €13 in advance gets you 4 shots, happy hours all night, and free entrance to a nightclub\r\n\r\n· You can also choose to pay €15 at the door of the first bar.\r\n\r\nSpecial offer to all the birthday folks: HALF-PRICE if your birthday has occurred or will occur within 5 days of the event.\r\n\r\nThe schedule is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Meet up: 8:00 PM - Meet us at 8.00 PM at Flag Café (5 bd Beaumarchais).\r\n\r\n2. First bar - In the first bar, meet up with other folks from all around the world and get your first free shot.\r\n\r\n3. Second bar: 9:20 PM - In the second bar, your fellow French pub-crawlers will join up, so you can practice your French (or body language if you don't speak French). You will get your 2nd shot at the end to keep you warm.\r\n\r\n4. Third bar: 10:30 PM – This is the last bar before clubbing, a nice warm atmosphere before the night gets crazy. And, of course, a new shot to keep you going strong!\r\n\r\n5. Clubbing: 11:40 PM - Let's all hit the club till the morning. Unlike Cinderella, make sure you stick around to get your final shot at midnight.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the Parisian Pub Crawl Pass gives you access to: · Happy hour all night long for beers, soft drinks, cocktails, and hard liquor\r\n\r\n· No extra charges for drinks after 1:00 AM\r\n\r\n· 4 free shots (one in each pub)\r\n\r\n· The chance to meet me (which is priceless :D)\r\n\r\n(IDs will be requested to enter bars)\r\n\r\nSee you on saturday\r\n\r\nFred.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \r\n¡Hola!\r\n\r\nDescubre el pub Crawl de Paris.\r\n\r\n¿Conoces el barrio de la Bastilla?

Cinema Club is a loose collection of French, Ex-pats and travellers from Couchsurfing who head off to the cinema each week on a Tuesday night. We see a wide variety of film, from old black and white classics, to cult hits, or modern alternative films. We choose a different cinema each week and a different style, but one thing remains, we do this, and have done this, every week since June 2011. If you're a traveller don't worry, we always watch English language films, and if you're french, don't worry, they always have subtitles. After the film we usually hang around and take a beer at a bar or along the Seine if the weather is nice and talk about the film, cheese, the finer things in life or whatever might float our way. Come along and enjoy good cinema and good company. \r\n\r\nDetails of this week's film will be online by the SUNDAY before the event. \r\n\r\n---Paris Cinéma Club---\r\nSo an Argentinian, an Australian and a Frenchman walk into a cinema… Every week night since June 2011, a different cinema, a different film, a cinematic experience and a beer.

    "description": "Open mic & jam every thursday in Paris, Île-de-France, France at Jul 09, 2015,  8:30 PM (CEST). I've been organizing those events weekly for the past 3 years with my talented singers and musicians friends that I have met on different concerts and TV shows in my 15 years in Paris, so you can hear some pretty cool artists and it's very nice to come and listen, or even play if you feel like it :) As I host a lot of couchsurfers and also post the event there and on Meetup, the atmosphere is quite international too with a pre-meeting with international travellers & expats from 8.30 to 9.30 before the music starts so people can get to know each other.\r\n\r\nThe drinks are pretty cheap compared to Paris prices, with happy hour prices all evening. And the bar is very central and easy to find, right by the métro exit in Saint-Michel. When the crowd is wild and we wanna keep playing, we actually often continue the jam by the river after 2 am.\r\n\r\nThe music usually starts around 9.30 but the Meeting starts at 8.30 so we can have time for drinks and get to know each other before I have to open the live session. You can find me easily (behind the sound counsol) if you arrive late though and I can point you to the Couchsurfers group.\r\n\r\nThe type of music depends on the performers who will show up. It's mostly pop, folk, rock, blues, soul, sometimes reggae, world music or rap. A little jazz sometimes, but it's mostly mainstream music.\r\n\r\nAll the sound system is in place and you can also borrow my electro acoustic guitar if you need, but it's still better to bring your own instrument if it can be plugged.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the quality of the performances for the audience, the first time performers should send me a link to one of their work or live videos, or you will have to play when the room is less crowded so I can know if I can release you in the wild jungle of a crowded audience later :)\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ INFO ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nBar : Le Carré Saint michel Address : 4, Rue Suger, 75006 Metro-RER : Saint Michel (line 4 - RER B). The rue Suger is facing the métro exit \"place Saint-André-des-Arts\" so it's very easy to find. If you get off at any other exit, then you have to go right on the Saint-Michel fountain and you'll be on place Saint-André-des-Arts. From the place, 2 streets go right, the rue Suger is the second one.\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ PRICES ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nIt's cover free but the bar owner won't be happy if you don't get at least one drink to help out the bar and the artists ;) The prices are cheaper than most places in Paris :\r\n\r\n✪ Various shots : 3,5 € ✪ Glasses of wine : 4 € ✪ Beer Pints : 4.5 € ✪ Cocktails : 6 €\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nRDV à partir de 20h30 au Carré Saint-Michel pour l'Open Mic & Jam du jeudi ! Un niveau correct est requis pour chanter 2 à 3 chansons ou pour jammer avec les habitués du Carré pour garantir un show de qualité au public. Les musiciens et chanteurs habitués sont issus des meilleures rencontres musicales que j'ai pu faire lors de mes 14 ans de musique à Paris, dans divers concerts ou même quelques émissions de TV comme Nouvelle Star, The Voice, X-Factor ou Popstars donc il y a pas mal de voix étonnantes :)\r\n",

    "description": "Cinema Club in Paris, Île-de-France, France at Jul 14, 2015,  7:00 PM (CEST). Cinema Club is a loose collection of French, Ex-pats and travellers from Couchsurfing who head off to the cinema each week on a Tuesday night. We see a wide variety of film, from old black and white classics, to cult hits, or modern alternative films. We choose a different cinema each week and a different style, but one thing remains, we do this, and have done this, every week since June 2011. If you're a traveller don't worry, we always watch English language films, and if you're french, don't worry, they always have subtitles. After the film we usually hang around and take a beer at a bar or along the Seine if the weather is nice and talk about the film, cheese, the finer things in life or whatever might float our way. Come along and enjoy good cinema and good company. \r\n\r\nDetails of this week's film will be online by the SUNDAY before the event. \r\n\r\n---Paris Cinéma Club---\r\nSo an Argentinian, an Australian and a Frenchman walk into a cinema… Every week night since June 2011, a different cinema, a different film, a cinematic experience and a beer. Viva la Paris.",

For every large CS meeting, it can always be a bit complicated to find a host, especially in places like Paris, so why not create a \"couch market\"? Surfers should post under \"Public comments\" & hosts under \"Attendee comments.\" \r\n\r\n► RULES:\r\n\r\n1) Keep it simple: number of people & dates.\r\n\r\n2) If hosts offer, read their profiles & write them a nice request, with links to your co-traveller(s) if it's for more than 1 person.\r\n\r\n3) Delete your post once you've found a host/can't accept more surfers.\r\n\r\n► This is only as a last resort, it's better to use the \"Find hosts\" tool and send personalized couchrequests first.\r\n\r\n► Remember to join the main event & the sub-events: \r\nhttps://www.couchsurfing.com/events/paris-rendez-vous-2015-9th-edition-17-20-july\r\n(Or https://www.facebook.com/events/798460406941746/?ref=4&source=4)",

    "description": "Open mic & jam every thursday in Paris, Île-de-France, France at Jul 16, 2015,  8:30 PM (CEST). I've been organizing those events weekly for the past 3 years with my talented singers and musicians friends that I have met on different concerts and TV shows in my 15 years in Paris, so you can hear some pretty cool artists and it's very nice to come and listen, or even play if you feel like it :) As I host a lot of couchsurfers and also post the event there and on Meetup, the atmosphere is quite international too with a pre-meeting with international travellers & expats from 8.30 to 9.30 before the music starts so people can get to know each other.\r\n\r\nThe drinks are pretty cheap compared to Paris prices, with happy hour prices all evening. And the bar is very central and easy to find, right by the métro exit in Saint-Michel. When the crowd is wild and we wanna keep playing, we actually often continue the jam by the river after 2 am.\r\n\r\nThe music usually starts around 9.30 but the Meeting starts at 8.30 so we can have time for drinks and get to know each other before I have to open the live session. You can find me easily (behind the sound counsol) if you arrive late though and I can point you to the Couchsurfers group.\r\n\r\nThe type of music depends on the performers who will show up. It's mostly pop, folk, rock, blues, soul, sometimes reggae, world music or rap. A little jazz sometimes, but it's mostly mainstream music.\r\n\r\nAll the sound system is in place and you can also borrow my electro acoustic guitar if you need, but it's still better to bring your own instrument if it can be plugged.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the quality of the performances for the audience, the first time performers should send me a link to one of their work or live videos, or you will have to play when the room is less crowded so I can know if I can release you in the wild jungle of a crowded audience later :)\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ INFO ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nBar : Le Carré Saint michel Address : 4, Rue Suger, 75006 Metro-RER : Saint Michel (line 4 - RER B). The rue Suger is facing the métro exit \"place Saint-André-des-Arts\" so it's very easy to find. If you get off at any other exit, then you have to go right on the Saint-Michel fountain and you'll be on place Saint-André-des-Arts. From the place, 2 streets go right, the rue Suger is the second one.\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ PRICES ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nIt's cover free but the bar owner won't be happy if you don't get at least one drink to help out the bar and the artists ;) The prices are cheaper than most places in Paris :\r\n\r\n✪ Various shots : 3,5 € ✪ Glasses of wine : 4 € ✪ Beer Pints : 4.5 € ✪ Cocktails : 6 €\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nRDV à partir de 20h30 au Carré Saint-Michel pour l'Open Mic & Jam du jeudi ! Un niveau correct est requis pour chanter 2 à 3 chansons ou pour jammer avec les habitués du Carré pour garantir un show de qualité au public. Les musiciens et chanteurs habitués sont issus des meilleures rencontres musicales que j'ai pu faire lors de mes 14 ans de musique à Paris, dans divers concerts ou même quelques émissions de TV comme Nouvelle Star, The Voice, X-Factor ou Popstars donc il y a pas mal de voix étonnantes :)\r\n",

You ve heard Paris is the capital of patisseries and desserts but never understood why... Here s your chance to get a glimpse at what Paris has best to offer in terms of sugary sophistication. Sweet tooth beware.... You might never want to leave after that!\r\n\r\n Follow two self proclaimed fine food amateurs in a walk your palate will remember. We ll show you nine of the best pastry chefs in Paris, most of them being legends (Conticini) or stars (Michalak).\r\n\r\n We ll start after lunch, just in time for the dessert (preferably have a very light lunch) and go till tea time or a bit later (maybe till the apero to have a sip or two in order to finish off our livers).\r\n\r\n If the weather allows, we ll go by foot. If not, then subway my friends!\r\n\r\nEach pastry is about 5€ and you can buy as many as you want in each pastry shop.   We suggest you share bites with your friends in order to discover the most flavours possible. Please dont bother coming without a budget as these places wont appreciate a horde coming in just to buy one cake (and therefore the number of attendees is limited).  \r\n\r\n A bottle of water or some tea might be a good investment in order to rinse that throat and make room for new saveurs.\r\n\r\n We ve done things well and  and made you a map, a list of the shops with their websites and suggestions of what to get there.  Exact route will be available as well as meeting point and phone numbers soon before the event.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zbbVOIR8y4TI.kPOgfzotklhQ&usp=sharing\r\n\r\n Foddies ahoy!!\r\n\r\n Jo and Adrien.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIERRE HERME\r\nde Pierre Herme.\r\nwww.pierreherme.com\r\n\r\nLes incontournables : \r\nL'Ispahan, l'Infiniment Vanille, le 2000 Feuilles.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA PATISSERIE DES REVES \r\nde Philippe Conticini.\r\nwww.lapatisseriedesreves.com \r\n\r\nLes incontournables : \r\nParis-Brest, Saint-Honoré, Grand Cru Vanille.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDES GATEAUX ET DU PAIN\r\nde Claire Damon.\r\nhttp://www.desgateauxetdupain.com\r\n\r\nLes incontournables : \r\nLe Kashmir, l'Absolu Citron et le Mont Blanc Cassis.\r\n\r\n\r\nARNAUD LARHER\r\nde Araud Larher.\r\nhttp://www.arnaudlarher.com\r\n\r\nLes incontournables : Tarte Bahia, Tarte au Citron, Cheesecake aux Agrumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAIN DE SUCRE\r\nde Didier Mathray.\r\nhttp://www.patisseriepaindesucre.com\r\n\r\nLes incontournables : le Baobab, le Rosemary et le Millefeuille Vanille.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATEAUX THOUMIEUX\r\nde Jean-Francois Piege :\r\nwww.gateauxthoumieux.com \r\n\r\nLes incontournables : Le chou-chou praliné noisette, le sablé citron et l'éclair blanc-manger \r\n\r\n\r\nLENOTRE \r\nde Guy Krenzer.\r\nwww.lenotre.com \r\n\r\nLes incontournables : Millefeuille, Eclairs Croquembouche, Butterfly Vanille Cassis.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE PLAZA ATHENEE\r\nde Christophe Michalak.\r\nhttp://www.christophemichalak.com\r\n\r\nLes incontournables : Religieuse Caramel au Beurre de Sel, Millefeuille Caramélisé au Trois Vanilles.\r\n",

Hello CSers and welcome to this event, part of our annual Paris Rendez-Vous!\r\n\r\nWe'll be covering about 2000 year of Paris history and seeing a lot of sites, mainly in the Latin Quarter.  \r\n\r\nBy the way, do you know why it's called Latin Quarter? (No, not because there are Latinos living there).\r\n\r\nDid you know that Paris was called Lutetia by the Romans, in the days of the Roman Empire and we can still see sites from that period?\r\n\r\nDid you know that in the middle of the 19th century downtown Paris was still a medieval area and it was Napoleon's idea to revamp it?\r\n\r\nDid you know that around that same period water was scarce and expensive that an English Sir (Wallace) had fountains built and we can still see them today? (it's the green water fountain in the pic of the event).\r\n\r\nWe'll be covering a lot of stuff during this event and we'll finish it in this area where they have an open air accordion \"steet ball\", in a very quaint neighborhood. \r\n\r\nMEETING POINT:\r\nExit of métro \"Cité\" on line 4.   I'll be wearing an orange CS bandanna.  Please be on time: I don't want to be wearing that bandanna for a long time!\r\n\r\nI'll send my number to participants via private message. \r\n\r\nSee you on Sunday. ",

The Paris RDV is the largest CS event of the year, bringing together all communities of CS in Paris and we're proud to be a part of it again. We're going to watch in the latin quarter then all head to the sunday night activities after the film. For more information on Paris RDV see the event here https://www.couchsurfing.com/events/625280\r\n\r\nCinema Club is a loose collection of French, Ex-pats and travellers from Couchsurfing who head off to the cinema each week on a Tuesday night. We see a wide variety of film, from old black and white classics, to cult hits, or modern alternative films. We choose a different cinema each week and a different style, but one thing remains, we do this, and have done this, every week since June 2011. If you're a traveller don't worry, we always watch English language films, and if you're french, don't worry, they always have subtitles. After the film we usually hang around and take a beer at a bar or along the Seine if the weather is nice and talk about the film, cheese, the finer things in life or whatever might float our way. Come along and enjoy good cinema and good company. \r\n\r\nDetails of this week's film will be online by the SUNDAY before the event. \r\n\r\n---Paris Cinéma Club---\r\nSo an Argentinian, an Australian and a Frenchman walk into a cinema… Every week night since June 2011, a different cinema, a different film, a cinematic experience and a beer.

    "description": "Open mic & jam every thursday in Paris, Île-de-France, France at Jul 23, 2015,  8:30 PM (CEST). I've been organizing those events weekly for the past 3 years with my talented singers and musicians friends that I have met on different concerts and TV shows in my 15 years in Paris, so you can hear some pretty cool artists and it's very nice to come and listen, or even play if you feel like it :) As I host a lot of couchsurfers and also post the event there and on Meetup, the atmosphere is quite international too with a pre-meeting with international travellers & expats from 8.30 to 9.30 before the music starts so people can get to know each other.\r\n\r\nThe drinks are pretty cheap compared to Paris prices, with happy hour prices all evening. And the bar is very central and easy to find, right by the métro exit in Saint-Michel. When the crowd is wild and we wanna keep playing, we actually often continue the jam by the river after 2 am.\r\n\r\nThe music usually starts around 9.30 but the Meeting starts at 8.30 so we can have time for drinks and get to know each other before I have to open the live session. You can find me easily (behind the sound counsol) if you arrive late though and I can point you to the Couchsurfers group.\r\n\r\nThe type of music depends on the performers who will show up. It's mostly pop, folk, rock, blues, soul, sometimes reggae, world music or rap. A little jazz sometimes, but it's mostly mainstream music.\r\n\r\nAll the sound system is in place and you can also borrow my electro acoustic guitar if you need, but it's still better to bring your own instrument if it can be plugged.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the quality of the performances for the audience, the first time performers should send me a link to one of their work or live videos, or you will have to play when the room is less crowded so I can know if I can release you in the wild jungle of a crowded audience later :)\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ INFO ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nBar : Le Carré Saint michel Address : 4, Rue Suger, 75006 Metro-RER : Saint Michel (line 4 - RER B). The rue Suger is facing the métro exit \"place Saint-André-des-Arts\" so it's very easy to find. If you get off at any other exit, then you have to go right on the Saint-Michel fountain and you'll be on place Saint-André-des-Arts. From the place, 2 streets go right, the rue Suger is the second one.\r\n\r\n▄▄▄ ★ PRICES ★ ▄▄▄\r\n\r\nIt's cover free but the bar owner won't be happy if you don't get at least one drink to help out the bar and the artists ;) The prices are cheaper than most places in Paris :\r\n\r\n✪ Various shots : 3,5 € ✪ Glasses of wine : 4 € ✪ Beer Pints : 4.5 € ✪ Cocktails : 6 €\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nRDV à partir de 20h30 au Carré Saint-Michel pour l'Open Mic & Jam du jeudi ! Un niveau correct est requis pour chanter 2 à 3 chansons ou pour jammer avec les habitués du Carré pour garantir un show de qualité au public. Les musiciens et chanteurs habitués sont issus des meilleures rencontres musicales que j'ai pu faire lors de mes 14 ans de musique à Paris, dans divers concerts ou même quelques émissions de TV comme Nouvelle Star, The Voice, X-Factor ou Popstars donc il y a pas mal de voix étonnantes :)\r\n",
